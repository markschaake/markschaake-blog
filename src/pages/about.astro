				<h1>About</h1>
				<p>
					I'm Mark Schaake, a software engineer and entrepreneur based in Denver.
				</p>
				<p>
					After selling my company, I'm now exploring what's possible when AI handles
					most of the coding. This blog documents what I'm learning about AI-first
					development, where the edges are, and what this means for how we build software.
				</p>
				<p>
					I work primarily with Claude Code, shipping projects faster than I ever could solo.
					The experience has fundamentally changed how I think about software development,
					and I'm writing to process those insights.
				</p>
