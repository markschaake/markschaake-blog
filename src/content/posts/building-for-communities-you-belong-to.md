My primary social outlet - outside of family - is my tennis club. I play a few times a week, often with my lifelong best friend Dan. Tennis keeps us in regular contact, and as a result, our relationship close. There's nothing like competitive sports - the physical and mental exercise of a tennis match just _feels_ healthy. At 46, that matters more than it used to.

I grew up playing tennis at this club. It's simply a special place to me. The people are good people - happy, caring, invested in something together. It's member-owned, which means we vote, we serve on committees, we show up for work parties. There's no corporate landlord. It's ours.

I also happen to build software for a living. And at some point I started to wonder - what if I actually built something for _this_ place? Not for users, not for a market. For my club. For the people I play with every week.

The idea started small - our club uses software that works, more or less, but it's old and clunky and owned by a company that doesn't know us. When something breaks, we submit a ticket. When we want a feature, we wait. It's the standard vendor relationship - we're customers, not partners.

I kept noticing friction. Booking courts was harder than it should be. Feedback from members disappeared into a void. The board had ideas but no easy way to act on them. And every time I noticed something, I'd think: _I could fix that._

So I started building. Not a startup. Not a product. Just - software for my club.

The difference is hard to explain until you've felt it. Building for strangers means guessing - interviewing users, running surveys, analyzing funnels, trying to understand people I've never met. It's necessary work, but it's _work_.

Building for my own community, I already knew. I knew the problems because I had them. I knew the people because I played with them. The feedback loop isn't a Slack channel or a support ticket - it's a text from a friend after Tuesday night doubles.

---

There's no pitch deck. No TAM calculation. No investor asking about my go-to-market strategy. The "market" is 500 members, and I know half of them by name. Success isn't MRR - it's whether booking a court on Saturday morning is easier than it was last month.

A year ago, I wouldn't have taken this on. Building a full member portal - auth, reservations, payments, admin dashboards - is a lot of work. Not impossible, but enough that it would have felt like a second job. The kind of project that starts enthusiastic and dies quietly in a half-finished GitHub repo.

But the tools have changed. I build with Claude Code now, and it's genuinely different. Not "AI writes my code for me" different - more like having a senior engineer available at 6am when I'm working before the day starts. The velocity is higher. The activation energy is lower. Projects that used to feel like a six-month commitment now feel like something I can chip away at on weekends.

That shift matters. It means passion projects are actually _possible_ again. Not just for companies with engineering teams, but for one person who cares about their tennis club and knows how to ship software.

---

I'm not suggesting everyone should build software for their tennis club. But most of us belong to _something_. A gym, a church, a hobby group, a neighborhood association. Communities that matter to us, run by people we know, with problems we understand.

What would it look like to build for them?
